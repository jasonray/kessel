dequeue(callback)
- where callback is a function(jobRequest, commit, rollback)
- jobRequest represents the job dequeued.  Will be null/empty if there was no item on the queue
- where commit is a function(commitComplete)
-- where, of course, commitComplete is a function indicating that commit is complete
- where rollback is a function(rollbackComplete)
-- where, of course, rollbackComplete is a function indicating that rollback is complete
