"You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?â€¦It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs."

## Background
Kessel is a lightweight framework for handling distributed delayed job processing.  This can be useful for any background jobs that you need within your application.

Consider the following scenarios:
-   After a customer purchases items from your site, your system needs to process the order as a background job
-   When a patient has a pending medication order, your system needs to perform medication/allergy checks
-   As new metric data becomes available, periodically create derived data reports from raw data

## Features
-   Architect can map **job type to handlers**
-   Developers can **implement new handlers**
-   Producers can **request jobs** to be processed
-   Producers can specify **expiration** of job requests
-   Producers can specify **delay** (earliest date/time to execute job) of `job requests`
-   System automatically **retries on transient exceptions**, and **buries jobs** on fatal exceptions
-   System will process requests based on **priority order**

## Concepts
-   `job`: single delay processing tasks
-   `job request`: request to Kessel to perform a single job in the future
-   `handler`: the set of code to fulfil the `job request`.  This is where the extensibility of the system comes into play -> you create your own handlers with your logic and Kessel will delegate to your registered handlers.  Today, handlers are implemented in JavaScript
-   `queue`: Kessel uses an internal queue for holding the `job requests` that have not yet been implemented.  Currently there is support for a light weight in memory queue or [beanstalkd](http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/).

## API

### Model

#### jobRequest Model

| Field | Optional/Request | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | requred | unique identifier, created by Kessel job manager |
| ref | optional | identifier, create by job producer |
| type | required | job type is used to map to a specific handler |
| expiration | optional | Specifies the latest that a job may be processed.  This is provided as an absolute date/time as a JavaScript date (2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z) |
| delay | optional | Specifies the earliest that a job may be processed.  This is provided as an absolute date/time as a JavaScript date (2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z) |
| priority | optional | Specifies the order by which jobs will be processed.  0 is the highest priority, the lowest priority being approx 4M.  Negative numbers are treated as 0 |
| callback | optional | If a callback is provided it will be invoked when job is complete.  This is currently implemented with a JavaScript function callback ```function(err)```.  Pending: callbacks using HTTP endpoint |
| payload | optional | The payload is the content to pass to the handler |

#### jobResult Model

| Field | Optional/Request | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TODO: id | requred | unique identifier of result |
| TODO: request | requred | original request |
| value | optional | if the handler reported a single value, this will be populated here |
| status | required | The result of processing the message, valid values are `success`,`failed`,`failed-transient` |
| message | optional | This can be populated with the error message or other human-readable informative information |

### Job Manager API

#### Constructor
#### connect(callback)
TODO: should this be private?
#### start
#### request(jobRequest, callback)
#### processSingleJob(jobRequest)
TODO: should this have a callback

### Queue Adapter API

#### initialize(callback)
-   callback(err)
Description: if this queue adapter needs to do anything to initialize (such as connecting, do it here)

#### enqueue(jobRequest, callback)
-   jobRequest: see job request model
-   callback(err, jobRequest)

#### dequeue(callback)
-   callback is a function(jobRequest, commit, rollback)
-   jobRequest represents the job dequeued.  Will be null/empty if there was no item on the queue
-   commit is a function(commitComplete); commitComplete is a function indicating that commit is complete
-   rollback is a function(rollbackComplete); rollbackComplete is a function indicating that rollback is complete
-   TODO: consider error queue and rollback with delay

## Developer Support
### Developer Setup
First, make sure that you have `node`, `npm`, and `beanstalkd` installed.

If you do not, and are on a mac, here I recommend to first install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), then install using: `brew install node` and `brew install beanstalkd`

Next, clone the source code from [this repository](https://github.com/jasonray/kessel).

You will then need to setup dependencies: `npm install`

#### Run tests
To run the unit tests: `npm test`
To run the integration tests, ensure that beanstalkd is running on port :3000 (which can be started with `bin/start-queue.sh`) then `npm run integration-test`

#### Run checks
To run dependency checks: `npm-check`

## Development Guidelines
### Logging
In order to make the logs consistent, the following guidelines should be used:

| Level | Guideline |
| --- | --- | 
| error | Critical system errors that would result in process restarting | 
| warn  | Subsystem failures | 
| info  | Major startup item; <br> No more than once per job | 
| debug | Significant event while processing job |  
| trace | Majority of job level logging |  

| Example | Level |
| --- | --- | 
| Issue in framework that will cause system to halt | error |
| Unable to access dependant system | warn |
| Framework logging enqeue, dequeue, and completion of job (one or two log messages per job) | info |
| Handler logging | debug or trace |
